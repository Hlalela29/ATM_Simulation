Application that SimlateS an ATM Machine. When you start the program, the application must request you to
enter your four-digit pin number. If the pin number is not four digits long, the user is given two more chances to enter a valid pin number. If after two chances 
the user fails, the program ends; but if the pin is valid, the user is given transaction options to choose from, namely b for checking current balance, d for 
depositing money, w for withdrawing money and e for exiting the program. If the user enters b, the current balance is shown. If the user enters d, the user 
is given a option to enter the amount he/she wishes to deposit and update the balance with this amount. If the user enters a w, the user is given a chance to enter the amount he/she 
wishes to withdraw. If the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance, an error message will be displayed. If the user enters an e, the application will exit. 
the application will execute continuously as long as the user wants to. Lastly, the user of the application is assigned 1111 as a default pin at the beginning of 
the program. This pin will be compared once against the user entered pin before the transaction options can be given to the user. If the user enters 1111, 
the program will proceed to show the user the available options, otherwise two chances are to be given for the user to enter the match. Also, the starting balance is R1000.00.
